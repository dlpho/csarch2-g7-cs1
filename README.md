## 1. Introduction TODO
Briefly describe your project build (1–2 paragraphs).  
Mention: target use case (e.g., general-purpose desktop, gaming, programming, data science, etc.) and budget constraint.


This PC build is centered on the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, one of the fastest gaming CPUs available today. It delivers top frame rates by fully utilizing the GPU while staying efficient under load, running cooler and drawing less power than many alternatives. The goal of the system is straightforward: maximize gaming performance while keeping thermals and power use in check.

The build uses an MSI GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, a capable midrange GPU for smooth 1440p gaming and playable 4K in lighter titles. It is backed by 32 GB of DDR5-6000 memory, a fast 1 TB NVMe SSD for responsiveness, and a secondary 1 TB HDD for extra storage. Cooling comes from a 240 mm AIO and the case’s four stock fans, which ensures stable airflow. A 750 W gold-rated PSU provides reliable power with room for upgrades. The full build comes in under the ₱100,000 budget while targeting high-end 1440p performance and workable 4K in demanding games.

## 4. Compatibility Justification 
TODO
For each part, explain compatibility and choices.  
Example:  
- **CPU + Motherboard**: Intel i5-13400F (LGA1700) works with ASUS B760M board (LGA1700 socket, BIOS compatible).  
- **RAM**: DDR5 RAM supported by motherboard slots (up to 128GB).  
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 fits case, PSU wattage sufficient.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱100,000  
- **Final Total**: ₱99,690
- ✅ Within budget
- Initially, we chose an 8GB GPU and added aftermarket Noctua case fans, which brought the build to ₱99k. However, since the tower already included four fans (3 front + 1 rear), we decided to use the stock fans instead. This gave room for the 16GB GPU variant, as further analysis showed that 8GB could potentially bottleneck the performance of the PC.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
Reflections on:  
- Price differences (international vs. Manila vendors)
    Based on PC Part Picker, the total build is estimated to be lower when sourced internationally, around ₱10,000 less than Philippine-based parts. The prices from Philippine-based vendors are noticeably higher.
- Challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents
    Most of the top sites listed parts with higher prices. Some other candidate parts that possibly fit better in the build were also out of stock in most Philippine-based sites.
- What the group learned about PC components and system design  TODO
