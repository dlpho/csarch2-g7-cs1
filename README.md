## 1. Introduction
This PC build is centered on the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, one of the fastest gaming CPUs available today. It delivers top frame rates by fully utilizing the GPU while staying efficient under load, running cooler and drawing less power than many alternatives. The system is designed to maximize gaming performance while keeping thermals and power use in check, supported by the Deepcool AK400 Digital CPU cooler and stable airflow from the MSI MAG FORGE 321R AIRFLOW case with its stock fans.

The build pairs the CPU with an MSI GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB SHADOW 3X OC, offering high-end 1440p performance and playable 4K in demanding games. It includes 32 GB of DDR5-6000 memory, a 1 TB MSI SPATIUM M480 NVMe SSD for fast load times, and a 1 TB Seagate BarraCuda HDD for extra storage. A 750 W gold-rated PSU provides reliable power with headroom for future upgrades. The full system delivers premium gaming performance and responsiveness while staying just above ₱100,000 but not over 5% of the budget.

## 4. Compatibility Justification 

## CPU + Motherboard
- CPU: **AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D**, AM5 socket  
- Needs **B650 or X670 chipset** → chosen **MSI B650M-A WIFI**  
- Supports DDR5 memory and PCIe 4.0  
- BIOS update (v7D75vA3) may be required  

## CPU Cooler
- **Deepcool AK400 Digital**  
- Fits case clearance properly  
- Reliable air cooling for stable temps  
- Digital display helps with monitoring  

## RAM
- **G.Skill Flare X5 DDR5-6000, 32GB (2x16GB)**  
- DDR5-6000 is the sweet spot for Ryzen 7000 CPUs  
- 32GB is enough for gaming + productivity  
- Alternative: **TeamGroup DDR5 kits** also compatible  

## Storage
- **SSD: MSI Spatium M480, 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe**  
  - Very fast boot, load, and transfer speeds  
  - Fully supported by motherboard’s PCIe 4.0 M.2 slots  
- **HDD: Seagate Barracuda 1TB**  
  - Affordable bulk storage  
  - Good for files, backups, and media  

## GPU
- **MSI Shadow 3X OC RTX 5070, 12GB**  
- Excellent performance at **1440p**, good for **4K**  
- Supports **ray tracing + DLSS**  
- May struggle with ultra-demanding 4K titles  
- Best choice within budget  

## PSU
- **MSI MAG A750GL, 750W, 80+ Gold**  
- Enough power for CPU + GPU  
- Gold certified → efficient and stable  
- Leaves headroom for upgrades  

## Case + Cooling
- **MSI MAG Forge 321R (ATX Mid-Tower)**  
- Compatible with motherboard, GPU, and cooler  
- Good airflow + included stock fans  
- Comes with RGB lighting for aesthetics

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱105,000 (105% of 100,000)
- **Final Total**: ₱104,426.33
- ✅ Within budget
- Initially, we chose an 8GB GPU and added two aftermarket Noctua case fans, which brought the build to ₱k. However, since the tower already included four fans (3 front + 1 rear), we decided to use the stock fans instead. This gave room for the 12GB GPU that we chose, as further analysis showed that the previous 8GB GPU we chose could potentially bottleneck the performance of the PC. 5070 will ensure smooth 4K gaming even in demanding games.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
Price differences (international vs. Manila vendors)
 
When comparing our build to the PC Part Picker international price estimates, we found that our total build would have been roughly ₱10,000 cheaper if sourced abroad. The difference comes from Philippine-based vendor markups, shipping fees, and import taxes. While buying locally offers the benefit of warranty support and faster fulfillment, the downside is that components are noticeably more expensive compared to international pricing.

Challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents

Another difficulty we encountered was the availability of parts. Most of the reputable local PC vendors had higher prices, while some of the cheaper listings on platforms like Shopee or Lazada either had no reviews or looked unreliable. There were times when we identified the perfect part that fit our budget and requirements, but it was out of stock everywhere. This forced us to make small adjustments: for example, we had to change our choice of CPU cooler and RAM to slightly cheaper alternatives. Fortunately, the performance trade-off was minimal, so the overall build quality was not compromised.

What the group learned about PC components and system design

Through this project, we learned the importance of balancing compatibility, performance, and budget. It became clear that every component decision affects the whole system. For example, the CPU determines the motherboard socket, which then dictates the type of RAM we can use. We also realized the value of future-proofing, such as choosing DDR5 memory and a motherboard that supports newer standards. Another important lesson was how critical power supply selection and cooling are, since they directly affect stability and longevity. Overall, we gained a better understanding of how each part works together as a system, and how to make practical compromises when faced with real-world limitations like pricing and availability.
